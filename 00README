Folder for mental rotation experiments.

Code:

 - Code: Mental rotation experiment code
 - PaperMRT: Code to generate paper-and-pencil versions of the mental
   rotation task, based on Vandenberg & Kuse (1978).

Experiments:

 - sexdiff01: Sex differences study run in PSYC 4802 in Fall 2013.
   Shortened version of Shepard & Metzler's (1971) design.  Found a
   reliable effect of angle but no sex differences.
 - sexdiff02: Same as above for Spring 2014.  Used stimuli from Hochberg &
   Gellman (1977; shapes A and B).  Collected more data in Fall 2014.
   Found a reliable effect of angle but no sex differences.
