Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, it's important to understand this is not an 'exact' replication in many
respects. The original Shepard experiment predated fast 3D computer graphics
and was preformed using pre-made picture cards. This experiment uses
semi-random objects that bear a close similarity to the types of objects used
by Shepard.

I created this experiment in order to explore OpenGL interaction in under
Matlab. Additionally, I wanted to manipulate certain variables such as the
degrees type(class) of object to verify predictions made by emerging models of
top-down processes of human vision. This replication provided a convinient point
to start.

I hope others may find this code a useful starting point for their own work.


Setup & System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-A recent version of Matlab is required.
        -Tested on 7.7.0.471 on Ubuntu Linux v9.04.

-A modern video card supporting hardware accelerated OpenGL is required.
        -Tested on NVidia GForce 7100 GS

-The PsychToolbox version 3 must be installed and in the Matlab path.
        -Tested on 3.0.8, latest build as of 9-8-09.

-Move the files in this package to a directory in the Matlab path.

-Run 'Shepard( nTrials )' where nTrials is the number of trials.
        -The highest screen number detected on the system will be used.


Using
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Each trial displays two objects built from cubes. The objects will either be
the same objects, where one is rotated x increments of 20 degress on the XY
plane, or different objects.

-Press '1' if the objects are the same or '2' if they're different

-If the correct response is given, the objects will turn green. If the wrong
response is given, the objects will turn red.

-After all trials are complete, the response time for all correct responses
are plotted against the number of degrees rotated. Incorrect responses are
dropped from analysis.

-A linear fit is performed using all correct responses and plotted on top of
the individual responses.
